Unicode compliance linter that removes obvious AI authorship signatures

## Description

noemoji-rs is a linter that detects and flags obvious AI authorship signatures in code and documentation, particularly emojis and decorative Unicode characters that AI assistants frequently insert. By enforcing ASCII-first typography where appropriate, it helps maintain code that doesn't advertise its AI-assisted origins.
